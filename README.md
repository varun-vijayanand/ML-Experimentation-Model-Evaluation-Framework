# ML-Experimentation-Model-Evaluation-Framework
This framework supports reproducible, configuration-driven machine learning experimentation across different datasets and model types. It provides structure for running, tracking, and comparing ML experiments at scale.

## Key capabilities include:

- Config-driven experiment execution

- Model registry for easy swapping

- Dataset versioning support

- MLflow/W&B logging integration

- Standardized evaluation metrics

- Built-in ablation and perturbation tools

- Automatic results summaries and reporting

The framework helps establish scientific rigor in ML workflows and makes it easier to study model behavior under controlled conditions.
